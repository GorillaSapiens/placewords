ðŸš€ PlaceWords â€” A Free, Open, Offline Alternative to What3Words

Body:
Tired of What3Wordsâ€™ secret algorithm, lawsuits, and lock-in? I built PlaceWords â€” an open-source, patent-safe system that maps every 5-meter square on Earth to 3 easy words.

Free & Open (Apache 2.0)

Offline-Capable â€” perfect for remote work, disasters, and adventure

Patent-Safe â€” no infringement on W3W

Future-Proof â€” replace words, add languages, keep compatibility

Uses Googleâ€™s open S2 geometry system under the hood. Works anywhere, reversible back to coordinates, and you can self-host or embed in anything.
